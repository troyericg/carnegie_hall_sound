# Carnegie Hall Sound

An app that scrapes the carnegie hall calendar and allows you to listen to all of the upcoming performances.

Currently in progress, this app will eventually pull audio and photos from the Carnegie Hall calendar, and display it in a way that allows a user to simply scan and listen, without having to dig through deeper links to figure out which artist has music available for pre-show listening or not. Hopefully.

Originally inspired by Louis-Philippe Riel's [Rap Board](http://therapboard.com/)
